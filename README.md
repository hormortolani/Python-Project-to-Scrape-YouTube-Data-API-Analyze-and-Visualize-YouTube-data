# Python-Project-to-Scrape-YouTube-Data-API-Analyze-and-Visualize-YouTube-data

 

##### 1. Imported necessary libraries.
##### 2. Set up scripts to fetch YouTube data for listed channels.
##### 3. The function `get_channel_stats` uses the YouTube Data API to retrieve and process statistics (subscribers, views, videos, etc.) for given channel IDs, returning data           as a list of dictionaries.
##### 4. Created a function to process inputs and return relevant channel metrics.
##### 5. Used pandas to load and convert data into dataframes.
##### 6. Retrieved the playlist ID for the 'Yorubahood' channel from `channel_data`.
##### 7. Retrieved all video IDs from a YouTube playlist using the YouTube Data API.
##### 8. Extracted specific video details like title, likes, published date, views, dislikes, and comments, then loaded and converted the data into a dataframe.
##### 9. Visualized channel names by views and subscribers, highlighting Looper as having the highest metrics.
##### 10. Visualized monthly video details for the Yorubahood channel.
##### 11. Scraped video details from specified channels and saved as a CSV file for further analysis (Flamming Sword Ministries, Uchenna Mbunabo TV, Yorubahood, IBAKA TV, and             Looper).
